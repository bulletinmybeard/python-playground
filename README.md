## Medium Blog Scraper: Extract Titles, Links, and Publishing Dates
A simple Python script for scraping and compiling a list of article metadata from any Medium blog. By utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup to navigate and parse articles through infinite scroll pages, we extract titles, links, and publication dates and store this information in comma-separated text files (e.g., `blog_articles_rschu.me.csv`).

Running the script `poetry run medium_blog` will prompt for any Medium blog URL, including the discontinued custom Medium Blog domains. 

### Valid Medium Blog URL and content
```bash
Enter the Medium Blog URL (e.g., https://rschu.me): https://rschu.me
Processing Blog articles from: https://rschu.me
Found 113 articles so far                [/]

The given URL 'https://rschume' appears to be invalid.
